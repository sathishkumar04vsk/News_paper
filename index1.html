                    <p>HBO Max has developed a fondness for reunions after that awkward "Friends" gathering and "The West Wing" voting special. Yet "Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts" strikes just the right balance, looking back at the cinematic franchise with warmth and humor, while delicately capturing the impact on kids raised on a movie set over a formative decade.Perhaps foremost, this 100-odd-minute documentary -- shrewdly divided into four chapters, each encompassing two movies -- makes terrific use of clips and outtakes to illustrate its anecdotes and remembrances. </p>

                    <p>The White House said some of the records the House asked for potentially could concern state secrets or executive privilege because they were part of high-level national security deliberations, according to a letter from the White House counsel's office released Tuesday. The House said it would "defer" its e records. <br>
                        Another set of the documents that the House dropped pursuing may not have been all that helpful anyway because while they were created on dates the committee asked for, they did not pertain to the panel's investigation, the White House letter said. As a result, the committee won't be getting hundreds of pages of National Security Council records at this time. <br>
                        The revelation comes in a new round of letters is about the status of Trump-era documents held by the National Archives. It's the first time the Biden administration appears to have pushed back on more than a handful of pages of documents requested by the House select committee, as the National Archives works through thousands Trump administration. 
                        The White House made clear in its have the is improved  it's  still supportive of the House's inquiry on January 6, and that the latest deal over documents shouldn't "compromise its ability to complete its critical investigation expeditiously."The curtailing of the House panel's request will likely not affect its core mission of understanding then-President Donald Trump's  2020  at the US Capitol on January 6. </p>

                    "Everyone has the right to voice their opinion and what they feel about a certain situation, but I personally have never ever even thought of discriminating anyone over their religion -- and that is a very sacred and a personal thing to every human being, and that should be left there," he added.
